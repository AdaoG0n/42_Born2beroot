Overview
Born2beRoot is a project designed for students at the 42 school, aimed at providing practical experience in setting up and managing a Linux server. This project emphasizes the importance of virtualization, specifically using VirtualBox, to create a functional environment for learning system administration. Objectives

Virtual Machine Setup: Students will install a minimal version of Debian or CentOS as the operating system.
* User Management: Configuration of user accounts and permissions, including the setup of sudo for administrative tasks.
* Service Installation: Installation of essential services such as SSH, firewall (UFW), and database management systems (like MariaDB).
* Script Automation: Development of scripts to automate installation and configuration processes.

Key Features

* Virtualization: Utilize VirtualBox to simulate a server environment.
* Security Practices: Implement security measures including SSH configuration and user access controls.
* Resource Management: Learn to manage limited disk space effectively while maintaining system functionality.

Getting Started
To begin with the Born2beRoot project:

* Set up VirtualBox and create a new virtual machine.
* Install the chosen Linux distribution.
* Follow the guidelines for configuring necessary services and user accounts.

This repository serves as a documentation and resource hub for all related scripts, configurations, and project requirements.
